            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are used to make working with remote files much easier. On top of this, it makes group projects easier as well. It is similar to a library, where someone checks the file out, then checks it back in with their new changes. This allows two people to simultaneously work on a file without conflict. There are many benefits to this: files are not actually overwritten, all changes are noted, you can revert back to a previous version of the file at any time, and you will have a reliable backup of your files. There are many VCS's out there for use, some of the most popular being Git, Concurrent, and Subversion.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system, and it is open-source and free to use. One simple way to visualize Git is to think of a library. Libraries allow people to checkout a book, use it, and return it. Other people will then go on to use the same book, and they can see the changes made. On top of this, the library can have multiple copies of the book so multiple people can have the book at once.It is very versatile in its uses, and can handle small projects like this one, or large projects like Facebook or Amazon. Another great thing about git is its simplicity and efficiency. It stores remote files on each user's local machine, which means that you can work offline. It is a great prevention method for unintentional overwrites to the remote/main repository. These are just a few of the benefits of Git.</p>

            <p class="lead">Repositories are storage spots for files, which can be used remotely or locally. The result is a much safer method of project management, and the preservation of previous code. Remote repositories are storage spots for files remotely, such as a secure server or a database. These files are usually then stored locally to users that are granted permission. The user can then work on the file locally without having to worry about ruining a project. This makes project management much easier because you can share files much quicker and safely. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Some of the most common Git commands are commit, branch, revert, push, fetch, pull reset, checkout, merge, and rebase. Each one of these commands plays a very important role in the use of Git. Git Commit is used in order to commit the changes to the repository. So basically it is like clicking the 'save' button on a document. Git Init is used to initialize a repository. This is basically saying that it creates an instance of the repository. Git Add is the command for adding files to the repository, however it only adds the files that were changed since the last backup to the staging area. Git Pull is used to get remote files on to a local machine. Git Push is used to do the opposite, it pushes the files on to the remote server from the local server. These are just a few basic commands for using Git.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">How it All Works</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In summary, Git operates as a method of file management that can be used for a wide variety of reasons. It works by creating, or initializing, a repository locally or remotely. This is easily done by typing 9 letters. Then you upload files to the repository, and you can either push or pull them. This is a fancy way of saying that you can either get a remote copy on to your local machine, or put your local copy on to the remote repository. If you push a file, then when you run Git Add, your changed files are backed up to the staging area, where the will be saved if you use Git Commit. The main benefit of Git is that it keeps backups of the files in the remote repository and allows you to see these files, as well as all changes that have been made. This allows for the blaming of someone who wrote bad code, since their name will be on the changes. All in all, git is a useful tool for working on projects remotely or locally. </p>
